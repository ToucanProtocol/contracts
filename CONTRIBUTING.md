# Contributing to Toucan Protocol

You are welcome to [file issues][issues] or [pull requests][PRs] in
this repository.

You can also reach us on our [Discord server][].

We are currently very early in our journey towards [publishing the
protocol as Open Source][OSS blog], and this is a big task which will
take time, so please bear with us.  As we publish more components,
collaboration with the community will become progressively easier.
